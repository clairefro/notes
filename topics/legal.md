"The Howey Test refers to the U.S. Supreme Court case for determining whether a transaction qualifies as an "investment contract," and therefore would be considered a security and subject to disclosure and registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934."

An investment contract is:

- An investment of money
- In a common enterprise
- With the expectation of profit
- To be derived from the efforts of others
